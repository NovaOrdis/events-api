/**
 * A source of metrics. Implies an underlying mechanism that can be exercised to obtain a set of values for a set of
 * metric definitions, ideally in a single operation, for performance reasons. However, the implementations are free
 * to define what "efficient reading" means. Example of metric sources:
 *
 * 1. Local O/S instance can be queried for metrics such as free memory, CPU usage or disk space.
 *
 * 2. Remote O/S instance can be queried for metrics such as free memory, CPU usage or disk space over a SSH
 *    connections (assuming credentials are available and the system is reachable).
 *Ë™
 * 3. The JMX bus of a local or remote Java virtual machine.
 *
 * 4. The management controller (standalone or domain) of a WildFly instance.
 *
 * The implementations must correctly implement equals() and hashCode(), as metric sources will be used as map keys.
 *
 * A metric source instance must be started before metrics can be collected from it. The start operation usually
 * implies expensive remote connection creation, initial state verification, etc. so metric source implementations
 * should be designed to be started once and then stay in that state indefinitely. However, the underlying connection
 * may break for various reasons during the metric source life, so it may become necessary to re-start a metric source.
 *
 * Implementations are NOT expected to maintain their own internal threads. The recommended way to manage sources
 * and collect metrics is to do it with external threads/executors.
